Each week, someone chooses the car everyone will drive the next week
and someone is chosen to tune that car before then. The tuner
will choose the next car after that. Like primary school, when all
the kids get in a big circle and take turns punching the kid to your
left.

To tune a car for RaceDay, start with finding the car in the discord
channel. It should be in there, somewhere at the end of all the noise
from the last race.

If you don't already own it, buy the chosen car from the Autoshow,
or Auction house.

Once you have it, go to your Garage (_"Car Hole" in the U.S._) and
get busy in Upgrades & Tuning. 

- Brakes are strongly encouraged
- Handling is nice to have

**The Important Bits**:

From My Tunings and Setup, save the tune and give it a name that
humans can input with a gaming controller. Keeping it alphanumeric
makes it nice and easy. Don't forget to share!

The hardest part: Go to Find Tuning Setups and find your tune.
Use the name as the description. Aren't you glad I told you to
make it simple? Once you find it, view the
Share Code. Write it down or take a screenshot.

Post your tune name and tha share code in the Discord.

You are a hero.
