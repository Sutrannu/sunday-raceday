- How do I join the convoy?
  - Ask someone on discord to send you an invite
- Do I need to drive a specific car?
  - Yes, and you need to have the tune applied to the car, too
  - **If this is your first time**, you don't need to sweat this
    - When a race event starts, the car selection will appear first
    - Move one space to the left and choose to borrow the
      leader's car for the race
  - The car and tune are in the [list of races](../race).
    A link is posted in discord on Sunday.
  - The car and tune _should_ be somewhere in the discord channel
    posted in the last week.
  - You need to buy the car in the Car
    Show, if you don't own it
  - Search for the tune by the share code, or the name
- The event started and I'm not in it. What now?
  1. Panic!
  1. Let the convoy know you missed it so they can panic too
  1. Everyone in the race will _not touch anything_ until the
     race times out
  1. Try again
- I'm stuck!
  - _That's not a question_
  - Open the menu and look for a "Reset your car" option at the bottom
    of the screen
- Should I panic?
  - Yes.
- What's the long boi?
  - The last, but usually not the least, race is a really long one.
  - like, 15-20 minutes
  - There is usually a nature break right before
  - Do no cross the finish line unless you are in last place.
    Last goes first, then the rest.
- What's "Bread"?
  - _Scramble with Bread_ is a rediculous track we race every week
    1. Don't trust the racing line \>\>\>
    1. If you get reset, spin in circles until you see a checkpoint
       callout in the sky
    1. Last goes first (see long boi)
    1. Blame RenAigu
- How do I buy a car from [Backstage]({{< relref "backstage.md" >}})?
- Did I win?

    break it
