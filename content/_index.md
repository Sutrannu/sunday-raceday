## MissionDeep Sunday RaceDay

Welcome to the race!

Every Sunday at 2PM Eastern time the Club MissionDeep racers get together
to play Forza Horizon 5.
You can join the [MissionDeep Discord](https://briandunaway.com/live/) to be a
part of the chaos and fun.

## Getting Started

**You need to play solo first.**

We race in a convoy in [FH5](https://forza.net/horizon). To join a convoy,
you need to play through some of the game and unlock online play. How much?
About an hour or so.

This will also help you to get a little cash for buying cars. Every
week a racer [picks the car](./cars/) we all drive, and another [creates a tune](./tuning/)
that we all apply to the car. Both cost in-game currency you collect
by playing, racing, blah, blah. Racing on Sundays quickly becomes
enough to sustain your new habit.

## Joining a Convoy

The best way to join the convoy is to make friends. Did I mention you
get all this and friends too? Once you're in the discord sunday-raceday
channel or voice chat at race time, ask for an invite and someone will
oblige. There are almost always folks hanging out and buying cars before
race-time.

## Why PANIC?

It's FH5. When the convoy leader starts an event (race), you need to 

- Be out of any menus, freely driving your car around
- Be ready to hit the button to join the event

That's enough to induce panic in most drivers.
So, come ready for fun and a little panic.

## More Questions

FH5 is ... complicated. It can be hard to navigate and find that one
function you're looking for. We've got a [FAQ here](faq), and you should
feel free to ask questions, as dumb as you like, in discord.
