There is a magical land called Event Lab Island. It's a land of boring nothingness
that some dare to visit even if it crashes their game.

Perhaps it's the stark expanse of concrete wasteland, and the under-stimulation
that lead to Hand Ball.

> Hando Ball: a combination of futbal, rugby and olympic diving
or is it football? or either?

> I'm the ball. People try to kick me into the ocean on Event Island while I'm doing my impression of 1990s American sports radio. Almost forgot. Last car to touch me is the winner.

~ Hando, the A/V Guy (the ball)

## How to play

When everyone is on Event Lab Island, have a look around for Hando's flag. If you can't find it, best to head for the largest group of cars. Hando's probably already in the scrum.

The goal is to push Hando into the ocean, and be the last to make contact before you hit the water. The strategy is up to you.

When things get heated, FH5 will start ghosting cars, even Hando. Just remember, none of this is fair, or makes any sense.
