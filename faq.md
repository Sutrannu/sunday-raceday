title: Sunday RaceDay F.A.Q.
---

- I'm stuck!
  - That's not a question
  - Open the menu and look for a "Reset your car" option at the bottom
    of the screen
- Why is WScottis1 freaking out?
  - Can't find the "A" button
- How do I join the convoy?
  - Ask someone on discord to send you an invite
- Why did someone ram me when we're not racing?
  - They're just being friendly
- Do I need to drive a specific car?
  - Yes. And you need to have a specific tune applied to the car.
    **If this is your first time**, you don't need to sweat this.
    When a convoy race starts, the car selection will appear first.
    you can move one space to the left and choose to borrow the
    leader's car for the race. 
  - The car and tune _should_ be somewhere in the discord channel
    posted in the last week. You need to find the car in the Car
    Show, if you don't own it. The tune you'll
    need to search for by the share code, or the name.
- Should I panic?
  - Yes.
- What's the long boy?
  - The last, but usually not the last, race is a really long one.
  - like, 15-20 minutes
  - There is usually a nature break right before
- What if I loose?
  - You won't. Sutrannu is racing.
- Did I win?
  - It's really about the journey
  - We keep score and post it in Discord
  - If we're tied at the end of the long boy, we drag race to
    break it
-
