## MissionDeep Sunday RaceDay

Welcome to the race!

Every Sunday at 2PM ET the Club MissionDeep racers get together to play
Forza Horizon 5.
You can join the [MissionDeep Discord](https://t.co/uQa7fOuaKp) to be a
part of the chaos and fun. 

## Getting Started

**You need to play solo first.**

We race in a convoy in FH5. To join a convoy, you need to play through
some of the game. How much? Like most things in FH5, no one who gets
there cares enough to remember. It's a mystery of apathy. Plan
to play the game solo for an hour or so to unlock online play.

This will also help you to get a little cash for buying cars. Every
week a racer picks the car we all drive, and another builds a tune
that we all apply to the car. Both cost in-game currency you collect
by playing, racing, blah blah. Racing on Sundays quickly becomes enough to
sustain your new habit.

## Joining a Convoy

The best way to join the convoy is to make friends. Did I mention you
get all this and friends too? Once you're in the discord sunday-raceday
channel or voice chat at race time, ask for a invite and someone will oblige.
There are almost always folks hanging out and buying cars before race-time.

## Why PANIC?

It's FH5. When the convoy leader starts an event (race), you need to 

- Be out of any menus, freely driving your car around
- Be ready to hit the button to join the event
- Have enough bodily control to hit the correct button, and drive
  - Though, the last bit isn't strictly necessary

All of this is is enough to induce panic in the most stoic drivers. 
So, come ready for one thing, above all others. Panic.

## More Questions

FH5 is ... complicated. It can be hard to navigate and find that one
function you're looking for. We've got a [FAQ here](faq), and you should
feel free to ask questions, as dumb as you like, in discord.

## Streamers

Several racers stream the races. Check out [their profiles](streamers), and drop in
sometime to experience the madness.
